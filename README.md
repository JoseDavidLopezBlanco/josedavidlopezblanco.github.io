# About me

I am a PhD candidate at the European University Institute and I am interested in broad topics such as social stratification. 

I studied a BA in Politics and Public Administration (Summa Cum Laude). Shortly after, I completed a Master in Research in Social Sciences at the Juan-March Institute. During these studies, I also worked part-time as RA at the “GEMM” project and collaborated within the D-Lab.
This training has given me a strong background in both substantive and methodological skills, which has allowed me to be awarded a Salvador Madariaga Scholarship to continue my research as a PhD Candidate at the European University Institute.



## Research

At the moment, I work on topics related to the transmission of intergenerational advantages and Inequality of Educational Opportunities. I use quantitative methods and (aim for) causal inference designs.
