## Stata packages
This package provides harmonisation routines to convert Spain’s CNO-11 occupational classification (INE) into ISCO-08 at different digit levels (2, 3, and 4 digits), using the official crosswalk tables published by INE. The aim is to make it easier for applied researchers working with Spanish survey or administrative data to derive ISCO-based class schemes (EGP, ISEI, SIOPS, Oesch/OEPS, etc.).
