Hi!
Hi! I am José David López Blanco, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the National Distance University of Spain (UNED), where I work on the project Multidimensional Masculinities and the Gender Divide: A Comparative and Intergenerational Analysis (MULTIDIMENSIONAL).  My research focuses on how social stratification shapes people’s lives across various dimensionswith a particular focus on gender inequalities, social and spatial mobility, sustainable ageing, and educational trajectories. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Political and Social Sciences, University of Bologna, where I worked on digital inequalities among older adults within the ICTAGE project and Spoke 5 of AGE.IT. In parallel, I have continued developing research on internal, international, and return migration, with particular attention to their implications for social mobility across generations.

I completed my Ph.D. at the University Carlos III of Madrid, where I studied internal and international migration during Spain’s economic crisis in the 2010s. Beyond research, I have enjoyed teaching undergraduate courses at the University Carlos III and serving on Master’s thesis committees at Universidad Europea de Madrid. My academic journey has also taken me to institutions such as Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona as a research assistant and the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB) as a Visiting Scholar.
