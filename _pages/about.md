About me
======

Hi, welcome to my site!

I am Sociologist from Almer√≠a, a small city by the mediterranean in Spain. I am a PhD Candidate at the European University Institute (Florence, Italy) but this semester I am a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (USA). 

I am interested in broad topics such as social stratification, with a particular focus on educational inequalities. At the moment, I work on topics related to the transmission of intergenerational advantages and Inequality of Educational Opportunities. I use quantitative methods and (aim for) causal inference designs. I have also developed an interest on policy analysis.

If you work on similar topics or are interested in my work, please get in touch!
