About me
======

Hi, welcome to my site!

I am social scientist from Almer√≠a, a small city by the Mediterranean sea in Spain. Some might say its one of the [sunniest cities](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,almeria-andalucia-es,Spain) in Europe. 

I am a PhD Candidate at the European University Institute (Florence, Italy) but this semester I am a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (USA). 

I am interested in broad topics such as social stratification, with a particular focus on educational inequalities. At the moment, I work on topics related to the transmission of intergenerational advantages and Inequality of Educational Opportunities. In my research I use quantitative methods and (aim for) causal inference designs. 

Recently, I have also developed an interest on policy analysis. My research has been featured in [elDiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/abrir-casas-apuestas-cerca-institutos-baja-rendimiento-escolar-barrios-humildes_1_8440297.html), [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/10/31/sociedad/1635675473_674477.html), and [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211107/casas-apuestas-proximidad-colegios-barrios/2211660.shtml), in Spain.

If you work on similar topics or are interested in my work, please get in touch!
