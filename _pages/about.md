About me
======

Hi, welcome to my site!

I am quantitative sociologist from Almer√≠a (Spain), one of the [sunniest cities](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,almeria-andalucia-es,Spain) in Europe. 

I am a PhD Candidate at the European University Institute (Florence, Italy) and for the Fall semester 2021, also a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (USA). 

I am interested in broad topics such as social stratification, with a particular focus on educational and health inequalities. In my research I use quantitative methods and (aim for) causal inference designs. You can learn more about my research [here](https://marespadafor.github.io/research/).

I also have a keen interest on policy analysis. I'm a Junior Fellow of Future Policy Lab (FPL), a recently-created think tank whose aim is to shape the public debate in Spain about the most pressing issues of our time. My research has been featured in [elDiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/abrir-casas-apuestas-cerca-institutos-baja-rendimiento-escolar-barrios-humildes_1_8440297.html), [Cadena SER](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/10/31/sociedad/1635675473_674477.html), and [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211107/casas-apuestas-proximidad-colegios-barrios/2211660.shtml), in Spain.
