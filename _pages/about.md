Hi!
I am José David López Blanco, a Research Fellow at the University of Bologna (Italy), affiliated to the Department of Political and Social Sciences.
Hi, I’m José David López Blanco, a Research Fellow at the University of Bologna. My work revolves around understanding how social stratification shapes people’s lives across different dimensions—migration and labor market integration, the link between spatial and social mobility, gender and educational inequalities, fertility and family arrangements, and later-life outcomes. I’m particularly interested in how these dynamics intersect with each other and play out over time.

My Ph.D., which I completed at the University Carlos III of Madrid, focused on internal and international migration during Spain’s economic crisis in the 2010s. I explored how migration decisions were made and how migrants integrated into the labor market. These days, my research spans two key areas: digital inequalities among older adults in Italy, as part of the ICTAGE project, and the impact of return migration on social mobility—both for migrants and their descendants—tracing back to the large-scale migrations of the 1950s-1970s.

Alongside research, I’ve enjoyed teaching Bachelor’s courses at the University Carlos III and serving on Master’s thesis committees at the Universidad Europea of Madrid. My academic journey has taken me to exciting places, like Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona as a research assistant and the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB) as a Visiting Scholar.

Whether it’s analyzing how families navigate fertility decisions or the barriers to accessing education and technology, I’m passionate about understanding the structures that shape opportunities—and finding ways to challenge the inequalities that persist.
