About me
======

Hi! Welcome to my site. I am Sociologist from Almer√≠a, a small city by the mediterranean, in Spain. I am a PhD Candidate at the European University Institute (Florence, Italy) but this semester I am a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (USA). 

I am interested in broad topics such as social stratification, with a particular focus on educational inequalities.

If you work on similar topics or are interested in my work, please get in touch! 

I am very active on twitter, see bellow what is the last thing I tweeted about.
