Research
======
I am broadly interested in migration and ethnic relations: how the interplay between individual and contextual factors shape migration decisions, and how their integration differs according to the context of destination and resources embedded within ethnic ties.

 

I am part of the research network  [GEPS](https://www.geps.es/) (Grupo de Estudios de Población y Sociedad). 

Besides migration, I am also interested in economic sociology and demographic phenomena.

## López Blanco, J.D. Not What, but Where: The Socioeconomic Mobility of International Returnees and Internal Migrants in Spain
<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>
This paper contributes to the economic sociology of return, focusing on how returnees can use their acquired resources to gain economic mobility in their home countries. It fills an important gap in the literature: the comparative valuation of human capital acquired abroad versus comparable opportunities in the home country. By distinguishing between non-migrants, internal migrants, and international returnees, I examine the economic impact of return using micro-level survey data from a representative sample of Spanish university and vocational graduates. Although occupation-specific and general migration experiences generate higher returns for returnees than for internal migrants, only returnees with the most successful migration trajectory have an advantage, while the rest of former international migrants are disadvantaged compared to non-migrants. As this could be due to the segmented reintegration of returnees, especially in terms of educational background and regional labour market characteristics, the results show the double-edged nature of international migration in promoting social mobility or deepening inequality.

## López Blanco, J.D. Language and Migration. An Analysis of Linguistic Capital in Internal and International Migration.
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Language skills have been shown to be a key element in migration decisions. Given the multifaceted
nature of language as a productivity enhancer, status marker, and ethnic boundary, the literature has
traditionally examined the various mechanisms through which language influences migration under
the theoretical frameworks of human capital, cultural capital, and social capital. However, the
simultaneity and interaction of these dimensions is rarely explored. In this paper, I propose the
concept of linguistic capital as a comprehensive theoretical model that explains the relationship
between language and mobility. Using data from Spain, I compare the effects of language proficiency
between bilingual minority native speakers and monolingual native speakers as an example of
individuals with a larger language repertoire without motivational selectivity. The results suggest that
language gives bilinguals an advantage in their multilingual economy. As a result, bilinguals are less
likely to move away from their language boundary than monolinguals, except for migration to areas
with the same language policy. Finally, the results suggest that bilingualism influences migration by
making it easier to acquire a third language due to the decreasing cost of acquiring new languages.

## López Blanco, J.D. Internal and International Migration in “Schengenland”. Selectivity of the young Spanish migration
<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>
The  study  of  the  links  between  internal  and  international  migration  has  traditionally  been  neglected  in
migration research. This gap is even more striking in the case of the countries of the European Union, as the policy
of free movement and the creation of a common labour market have placed intra-European mobility in a liminal
state:  neither an unlimited space of free movement nor a classic example of cross-border restrictions.  This paper
addresses the question of whether - and how - intra-European migration differs from internal migration in terms
of migration selectivity.  It does so by using comparable micro-level survey data from a representative sample
of Spanish graduates and vocational trainees.  The results show that internal and intra-European migration are
positively selected with respect to education and that the strength of the selection mechanism is similar for them,
especially compared to non-European international migration,  where positive selection is stronger.  They also
show that the nature of each resource influences migration decisions,  as its transferability or location-specific
utility determines which migration path is chosen. Finally, the results also highlight the important role of regional
inequality in determining selectivity among migration projects.
