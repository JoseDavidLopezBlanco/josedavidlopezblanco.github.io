I am broadly interested in inequalities: how these are transmitted through generations or through different institutional configurations.

In my thesis, I look at how institutional barriers and random events unevenly affect children's educational outcomes across family origin. My thesis provides new empirical evidence on how from birth throughout school both processess of selection and on compensation ultimately lead to the observed educational inequalities across family origins. All in all, I show how, across several outcomes and measurments of family origins, naive models consistenly underestimate the intergenerational transmission of inequalities. 

I have recently joint the [GEOSMINE](https://www.fabriziobernardi.net/the-geography-of-social-mobility-in-europe/) (Geography of Social Mobility in Europe) project, lead by Fabrizio Bernardi and based at the [CLIC](https://www.eui.eu/Projects/CLIC) (Comparative Life Course & Inequality Research Centre). This project's aim to understand how the interplay between place of birth and social class of origin affect the intergenerational reproduction of inequalities.

Given my interdisciplinary background, I am also interested in how historical and contemporary states and the rule of law can shape or produce (if any) inequalities. For example, I am developing a project which looks at the consequences of women's reproductive rights, and other which explores the impact of state building decisions in the aftermath of a civil conflict.

## Espadafor, M. Are boys more vulnerable to family disadvantage? Evidence from the United Kingdom.
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
There is a growing literature showing the importance of family socioeconomic status (SES) for explaining the male disadvantage in education. However, when and through which channel these gaps emerge remains unclear. This article examines whether and when family SES moderates gender differences in several educational outcomes. 
Focusing on the timing and the domain of the gender-SES gaps, this article contributes to the literature by testing the relative importance of birth characteristics, academic skills and values for explaining the gender-SES gap in education. To test these channels, I use the Millennium Cohort Study and focus on children's trajectories from birth to age seventeen.
Results suggest that girls and boys within each level of family SES start with equal health at birth and cognitive abilities throughout schooling. In contrast, high-SES families are able to moderate and compensate for the higher incidence of boys externalising behaviours and school detachment as gender identities become more salient at school.

## Espadafor, M. & Bernardi, F. The uneven risk and effect of grade retention across family origins.
<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>
This chapter focuses on the uneven effect of a remediation policy within the educational system: grade retention. We study the transition from Compulsory Education to higher secondary education in Spain, where retaking is relatively high. We investigate whether retaking a grade during compulsory education reduces the probability of remaining in the education system and whether the effect of retaking on school continuation decisions differs by family socioeconomic status. We leverage differences in regional educational laws to use an Instrumental Variable design that accounts for selection bias in educational transition models. Results show that (1) high-SES families are able to moderate the risk of falling into grade retention, but that (2) increases the chances of dropping out for all. However, (3) its effect is substantially more detrimental for children from low socioeconomic status. Finally, we show that naïve models that do not consider reverse causality and selection bias underestimate inter-generational transmission of educational inequalities. Results suggest that grade retention fails as a remediation policy and instead increases the inter-generational transmission of inequalities in education.

## Espadafor, M. & Passaretta, G. Does family socioeconomic status compensate for an early entry into school life? Evidence from Germany, with Giampiero Passaretta. 
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Previous literature shows that children who enter school at a younger age under perform compared to older classmates throughout school and adulthood.In this article, we analyse whether families differently react towards younger-for-grade children and when differences across family socioeconomic status (SES) in school entry age emerge. We contribute to the literature by providing an analytical example of one channel that could contribute to inequality in learning and achievement.
Using the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) and a novel research design, we estimate the effect of school entry age on various cognitive domains throughout primary education and in the transition to academic secondary school. First, we find that an early school entry age leads to lower cognitive abilities. Unlike previous studies, these effects are equal across family origins: high-SES families do not engage in remediation strategies for younger than grade students. However, by the time students reach the transition to secondary school, only low-SES younger than grade children have a lower likelihood to be recommended to the academic track.
Overall, our results suggest that while high SES families do not react towards a disadvantage in terms of performance, they do in terms of expected attainment. These findings challenge the compensatory advantage hypothesis, by which children from high SES families are less on prior negative outcomes.

## Garcia Sierra, A. & Espadafor, M. ll that glitters is not gold: addressing the effect of parental education on children's attainment.
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
The association between parental education and children's educational outcomes has been long studied. However, standard cross-sectional analyses often present endogeneity problems and fail to explore which parental characteristics drive these processes. In this article, we focus on the role of parental education. We explore if (1) changes in parental education are related, in the long term, to children's educational attainment and if (2) differential returns to schooling have implications for the overall transmission of educational (dis)advantages. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we leverage the 1970 Educational Reform in Spain to estimate the causal effect of parental education on children's attainment. This reform extended the compulsory school age, generating a sharp rise in educational attainment for the affected cohorts. Preliminary results suggest that exogeneous increases in educational attainment in the parent generation also translate into better educational outcomes for future generations. Conversely, these changes do not translate in an increase of the inter-generational transmission of educational inequalities across families.

## Espadafor, M & Kreiman, G. Can State-Building Decisions Equalize the Playing Field in the Aftermath of Civil War? Evidence from Perú
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>

What is the impact of civil war dynamics on educational outcomes? 
Previous evidence consistently shows the negative impact of civil war and wartime exposure on educational outcomes. This has been at the expense of neglecting one of the core dynamics in post-conflict scenarios: the expansion of state reach to wartime affected areas. 
In this paper, we argue that the expansion of state capacity, through increased access to primary and secondary education, can lead to potential improvements in the educational levels of people living in conflict affected areas, which ultimately reduce war-time inequalities. 
We test these arguments focusing on the Peruvian Civil War (1980-1992).First, we leverage novel census data (1961-2017) to analyse whether districts that were either contested or controlled by the insurgent group, Sendero Luminoso, had lower levels of educational outcomes right after the conflict. Then, using a Difference in Differences design, we test whether war-time inequalities are compensated through an expansion of state reach to these areas. We expect that those communities contested or under insurgent control (war-time areas) had lower levels of educational access and attainment than those controlled by the state. We expect these inequalities to decrease or disappear by state building initiatives, such as the provision of public schools. Our study aims to challenge existent evidence on the relation between civil war dynamics and civil war showing how the dynamics of state expansion could end up with some of the most pervasive inequalities developed by internal armed conflicts.
