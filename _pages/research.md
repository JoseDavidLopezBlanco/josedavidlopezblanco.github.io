## Espadafor. Are boys more vulnerable to family disadvantage? Evidence from the United Kingdom.
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
This article examines whether and when family socioeconomic status (SES) moderates gender differences on several educational outcomes. Although there is a growing literature showing the importance of SES for explaining the male disadvantage in education in the United States, when and through which channel these gaps might emerge remains, at large, unclear. Focusing on the timing and the domain of the gender-SES gaps, I investigate whether these emerge before, or after schooling. That is,  whether boys and girls from different social strata start unequal, or whether these differences emerge as the result of a cultural process—which is more  unequal for less advantaged families. To study these channels, I use the Millennium Cohort Study, a longitudinal panel from the United Kingdom, to focus on children's outcomes between the ages 3 to 14. First, against the skill deficit hypothesis, I find that girls and boys within each level of family socioeconomic status start out with equal health at birth and cognitive abilities throughout compulsory schooling. Favouring the cultural hypothesis, I find that the gender gap in externalising problems grows over time. Moreover, results suggests that high SES families are able to moderate the higher incidence of boys externalising behaviours at age 14, when gender identities become more salient at school.

## Espadafor & Bernardi. Selection or compensation? The uneven effect of grade retention across family origins.
<summary>Read more</summary>
This paper focuses on the uneven effect of a remediation policy within the educational system: grade retention. We study the transition from Compulsory Education to higher secondary education in Spain, where retaking is relatively high. We investigate whether retaking a grade during compulsory education reduces the probability of remaining in the education system and whether the negative effect of retaking on school continuation decisions differs by social origins. Drawing upon different data-sets, we use two innovative research designs that account for selection in educational transition models: an instrumental variable approach and a re-weighting technique. First, we find that grade retention increases the chances of dropping out for all, but its effect is substantially more detrimental for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Second, we show that naïve models that do not consider reverse causality and selection bias underestimate inter-generational transmission of educational inequalities. These findings suggest that grade retention fails as a remediation policy and instead increases the inter-generational transmission of inequalities in education.

## Espadafor & Passaretta. Does family socioeconomic status compensate for an early entry into school life? Evidence from Germany, with Giampiero Passaretta. 
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Previous literature shows that children who enter school at a younger age under perform compared to older classmates throughout school and adulthood.In this article, we analyse whether families differently react towards younger-for-grade children and when differences across family socioeconomic status (SES) in school entry age emerge. We contribute to the literature by providing an analytical example of one channel that could contribute to inequality in learning and achievement.
Using the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) and a novel research design, we estimate the effect of school entry age on various cognitive domains throughout primary education and in the transition to academic secondary school. First, we find that an early school entry age leads to lower cognitive abilities. Unlike previous studies, these effects are equal across family origins: high-SES families do not engage in remediation strategies for younger than grade students. However, by the time students reach the transition to secondary school, only low-SES younger than grade children have a lower likelihood to be recommended to the academic track.
Overall, our results suggest that while high SES families do not react towards a disadvantage in terms of performance, they do in terms of expected attainment. These findings challenge the compensatory advantage hypothesis, by which children from high SES families are less on prior negative outcomes.

## The Causal Effect of Parental Education on Children’s Attainment: an Approach Using the Spanish Educational Reform, with Alicia García Sierra. 
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Recent research on the intergenerational transmission of inequalities has placed importance on how to estimate these processes correctly. However, a lower degree of care has been given to defining what is being estimated. Standard cross-sectional analysis often presents endogeneity problems and fails to explore how and which parental characteristics drive these processes. 
In this article, we focus on the role of parental education. We explore if (1) changes in parental education are related, in the long term, to children's educational attainment and if (2) differential returns to schooling according to population heterogeneity has implications for the overall transmission of educational (dis)advantages. We contribute to previous literature by proposing educational reforms as an exogenous measure of improvements in parental education, net of other parental characteristics. We use the Spanish 1983's educational reform and data from the Labour Force Survey (1998-2019) to test our instrumental variable approach.
