The proliferation of on-site betting shops has received enormous public attention, becoming one of the most alarming health policy issues in contemporary cities. However, there is little evidence on whether its growing presence nearby vulnerable populations produce social harm beyond its known adverse individual effects. This study provides new evidence on the negative societal effects of betting houses. Our research design takes advantage of a new wave of openings in Madrid (Spain), which created a sudden increase in the supply of on-site gambling. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that an increase in gambling opportunities aggravates educational inequalities. Results reveal that the opening of betting houses nearby high schools declines educational performance, especially in public schools in less advantaged areas. We show that the effects of an increase in gambling opportunities are not small nor diminishing with time. In fact, they represent meaningful changes in school performance, which generated greater inequality. Unfortunately, the conditions for these results to hold---an increase in gambling opportunities around vulnerable populations---are met in many cities beyond Madrid. Our findings have relevant policy implications for designing policies tackling the increase of unequal opportunities promoted by betting houses.
