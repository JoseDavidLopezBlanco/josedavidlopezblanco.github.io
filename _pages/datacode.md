Talking about my academic career is talking about a fortunate accident.

Research was not my first choice. In fact, it was not even an option. I did a dual bachelor's degree in Law and Business Administration during the worst years of the Great Recession. Living in a country like Spain, where the economic crisis hit dramatically, I felt this was the only way to protect myself from unemployment and precariousness. However, during my studies there were few elements that motivated me. There was a gap between what I saw as a forced obligation and my personal interests that deepened every day.

And then, I started my first bachelor's thesis. It was the first moment I got in touch with research and the first time that everything I cared about was connected. It was creative, it was inspiring, it was meaningful. Encouraged by the grades of my two bachelor theses and the advice of my supervisors, I decided to enrol in a research master's in sociology and demography at the University Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona. The reason? I would like to say that it was my love for Merton or Weber. But I chose this master's degree because was one of the few research Master's programmes available at the time of my application. A matter of luck.

So a series of fortunate circumstances brought me to sociology, that strange place where everyone is welcome because nothing human is alien. I guess it was an instant crush. This passion is, at the same time, a duty and a gift. As a member of a generation that has been told to make crucial decisions in the face of  the bleakest scenario, understanding this process is not just an intellectual desire, but a moral obligation. However, it is also an endless enjoyment: like a shipwrecked poet writing in the sand what will be erased tomorrow, I truly believe that I will always wonder about the world I belong in and try to unravel its social dynamics, to understand who we are and who we can be.
