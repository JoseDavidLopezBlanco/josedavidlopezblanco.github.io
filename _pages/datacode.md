Talking about my academic career feels like telling the story of a fortunate accident.

Research was never part of the plan. In fact, it wasn’t even on the radar. I pursued a dual bachelor’s degree in Law and Business Administration during the height of the Great Recession in Spain. With the economic crisis devastating job prospects, I saw this path as my safest option to avoid unemployment and precariousness. Yet, as I progressed through my studies, I felt disconnected. The gap between what I was doing out of necessity and what truly sparked my interest grew wider every day.

Then came my first bachelor’s thesis. For the first time, I encountered research—and everything changed. It was creative, inspiring, and meaningful. Suddenly, everything I cared about came together. Encouraged by the positive feedback on my two bachelor theses and the advice of my supervisors, I decided to enroll in a research master’s in Sociology and Demography. Why this program? I’d love to say it was my admiration for Merton or Weber, but in truth, it was one of the few research-oriented Master’s programs available at the time.

And so, a series of fortunate circumstances led me to sociology, that wonderfully messy discipline where nothing human is alien. It was love at first sight. This passion is both a duty and a gift. As a member of a generation forced to make life-shaping decisions amid economic uncertainty, understanding these processes isn’t just an intellectual pursuit, but a moral obligation.

At the same time, sociology brings me endless joy. Like a shipwrecked poet carving words into the sand, knowing the waves will erase them tomorrow, I remain captivated by the world around me, armed with only a few certain truths: that all questions may never be fully answered; that social structures may never be perfectly understood; and that human agency will always retain an element of mystery. Yet I have learned that the struggle itself is enough. In wrestling with these endless puzzles, there is not frustration, but freedom. Like Camus’s Sisyphus, I find happiness in the work itself.

I will always strive to unravel the social dynamics that shape us, to understand who we are, and to imagine who we can become.
