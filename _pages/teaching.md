# [Drawing Maps in R](https://github.com/marespadafor/drawingmaps)

This is an introductory course on spatial data I taught within the CLIC Training workshops (as part of the Advanced Topics in Social Mobility research seminar) at the European University Institute in 2020.

## Labâ€™s Goals
- Introduce researchers to basic GIS concepts and how to read traditional GIS shapefiles in R
- Introduce researchers to the map outlines available in the maps package
- Show how to convert those data into data frames that ggplot2 can deal with
- Use ggmap and ggplot2 to make some pretty maps
- Discuss some ggplot2 related issues about plotting
- Using sp to plot maps with different projections
- Bonus: calculate distances and applications
